# Project RECLASS

Project RECLASS is a not-for-profit vocational program focused on teaching computer networking to incarcerated veterans. 

Prisons hand-select students for their discipline and likelihood to pass the Network+ certification exam. The classes facilitate open-ended discussion, whether they be sharing expertise from past experiences or asking for more clarification on the subject.

We also develop hands-on labs, including a visual network simulation tool to demonstrate Linux command-line troubleshooting tools such as `arp` or `ip addr`! This repository is a central location for that software as well as some learning modules!

# Projects

## ToyNet

[Official Design Document](https://github.com/takakonishimura/project-reclass/blob/master/toynet/README.md) | [Current usage of Terraform & Packer](https://github.com/takakonishimura/project-reclass/blob/master/infra/toynet/README.md) | [How to Get Started](https://github.com/takakonishimura/project-reclass/blob/master/toynet/ONBOARDING.md)

Most of our students do not have access to internet during or between classes, and many have never had hands-on experience with networks. This makes learning the Network+ curriculum a challenge of the imagination. What if we could run an internet simulation on a single host which can run basic system administrator capabilities on a variety of emulated devices?

ToyNet combines the network emulation capabilities of [Mininet](https://github.com/mininet/mininet) with the visualization capabilities borrowed from mingrammer's [Diagrams](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams) which was originaly built for system architecture diagrams of cloud infrastructure! The technology stack consists of a React frontend hooked up to a Django backend.

## Other Projects Up for Grabs

We still have lots of other projects we want to do! We are currently looking for volunteers to revamp our website and get started on a super-fun mobile game that can help active duty service members get a head start with the curriculum.
